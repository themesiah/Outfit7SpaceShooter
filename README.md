# Otufit7SpaceShooter

Make a simple 2D or 3D Space Shooter game in Unity3D. The key game components are:
1. Spaceship
2. Enemies
3. Obstacles
4. Powerups (weapons, shield,...)
5. Scoring
6. Background environment
7. Enemy behaviors (paths, formations)

The game can be very simple or as complex as you want, it’s really up to you. You can
demonstrate your Unity game development skills and creativity even more by adding more
features to the game like: advanced enemy behaviours, spaceship upgrades, animations, visual
effects, by using custom shaders, game menus and dialogs, sounds, multiplayer, etc…

As a result of the test please provide the game executable (Android apk or Windows exe ...)
and the Unity project with game code that can be run in Unity3D player and a short description
of what have you done and main challenges you had at development of the game.
